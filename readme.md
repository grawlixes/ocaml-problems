Solutions to https://ocaml.org/problems

I'm getting my ass kicked by Project Euler in this language so I need more practice.

My code style will probably look different in some problems as I try to learn what looks best. I'll also try some unconventional solutions just to familiarize myself with certain aspects of OCaml; if I solved everything with an auxiliary recursive function, it might be optimal, but it'd be boring.
